# Smart Image Captioning using BLIP

## üìå Overview
Smart Image Captioning using BLIP is an AI-powered system that generates accurate and context-aware captions for images. This project utilizes **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)** to understand images and generate human-like textual descriptions, enhancing applications like accessibility tools, content tagging, and image indexing.

## ‚ú® Features
- State-of-the-art image captioning using BLIP
- Supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
- Generates natural and coherent captions
- Easily extendable for real-world applications
- Uses **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face Transformers**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/prizbot/Smart-Image-Captioning-with-BLIP.git
   cd Smart-Image-Captioning-with-BLIP
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage
Run the following command to generate a caption for an image:
```sh
python caption.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```
This will output a descriptive caption for the provided image.

## üß† Model Details
The **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)** model is a cutting-edge vision-language model trained on large-scale datasets. It effectively understands image semantics and generates meaningful captions.
